## üìö Overview

The Gradle Artifactory Plugin provides tight integration with Gradle. All that is needed is a simple modification of
your `build.gradle` script file with a few configuration parameters, and you can deploy your build artifacts and build
information to Artifactory.

The plugin adds the `artifactoryPublish` task for each project, in the 'publishing' group. The task performs the
following actions on the project and its submodules:

1. Extracting the [build-info](https://www.buildinfo.org/) file located in the root project. This file contains
   comprehensive information about the build, such as its configuration, dependencies, and other relevant details.
2. Deploying both the generated artifacts and the build-info file to your Artifactory repository. This ensures that the
   artifacts, which are the output of the build process, and the accompanying build-info file are stored and organized
   in your Artifactory repository for easy access and management.

> **_NOTE:_** The minimum supported Gradle version to use this plugin is v6.8.1

<details>
<summary> üöö Migrating from Version 4 to Version 5 of the Plugin</summary>

## üì¶ Installation

<details>

<summary>Step 1 - Add the plugin to your project</summary>

---

Add the following snippet to your build script:

<details open>
<summary>Kotlin Format</summary>

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.jfrog.artifactory") version "5.+"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Groovy Format</summary>

make the necessary adjustments based on your platform information:

<details open>
<summary>Kotlin Format</summary>

```kotlin
configure<ArtifactoryPluginConvention> {
    publish {
        // Define the Artifactory URL for publishing artifacts
        contextUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8081/artifactory"
        // Define the project repository to which the artifacts will be published
        repository {
            // Set the Artifactory repository key
            repoKey = "libs-snapshot-local"
            // Specify the publisher username
            username = project.property("artifactory_user") as String
            // Provide the publisher password
            password = project.property("artifactory_password") as String
        }

        // Include all configured publications for all the modules
        defaults {
            publications("ALL_PUBLICATIONS")
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advance Configurations

For advanced configurations and finer control over the plugin's operations, refer to the following documentation that
outlines all the available configuration options. These options allow you to customize the behavior of the plugin
according to your specific needs.

The provided code snippet showcases the configuration options for the Artifactory plugin. It demonstrates how to
fine-tune the plugin's behavior to meet specific project requirements, access the Artifactory instance to which the
artifacts will be published, and configure other global settings such as Proxy and Build-Info extraction configurations.

<summary>üìãüîß Project Publication Configurations</summary>

---

The `artifactoryPublish` task configuration allows you to customize the task operation and behavior for a specific
project, in addition to the global defaults. The global defaults configuration applies to the project and its
submodules, while the artifactoryPublish configuration allows you to define additional settings specifically for the
project.
When using artifactoryPublish, you have the flexibility to configure additional values without overriding the global
defaults. This means that the project can have its own specific configuration in addition to the common settings applied
globally.
